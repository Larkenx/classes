In a normal (general) search problem, the optimal solution would be a sequence of actions leading to a goal state—a terminal state that is a win. In adversarial search, MIN has something to say about it. MAX therefore must find a contingent strategy, which specifies MAX’s move in the initial state, then MAX’s moves in the states resulting from every possible response by MIN, then MAX’s moves in the states resulting from every possible response by MIN to those moves, and so on.
