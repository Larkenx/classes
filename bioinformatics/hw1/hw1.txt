1) The output for FREQUENTWORDS("GAGTTAACGAACGCTTAAC", 3) will be "AAC"
since it appears 3 times, versus three other 3-mers which appear twice.

2) The run time for for Computing Frequencies is roughly (4^k) + (|Text| - k).
It is faster than frequentwords when k is smaller.

4) Mismatches(Text, k, d) // Finds the set of k-mer strings that differ by d.
    for i <- 0 to |Text| - k
        Pattern = Substring(Text, i, i + k)
        Map <- <Key: Pattern, Value: Neighbors(Pattern, d)>

    Neighbors(Pattern, d)
        for i <- 0 to d
