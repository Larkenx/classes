1) The output for FREQUENTWORDS("GAGTTAACGAACGCTTAAC", 3) will be "AAC"
since it appears 3 times, versus three other 3-mers which appear twice.

2) The run time for for Computing Frequencies is roughly (4^k) + (|Text| - k).
It is faster than frequentwords when k is smaller.

3) Mr Fuzzy's double-nested for loop is good because we are iterating through all the
characters of both P and all the possible letters of A, then replacing the letters
of Q (a tmp copy of P) at every character. The only issue is that Q is never initialized
back to P at the end of each loop, so after we add Q into S, we should re-init the variable like:
  Q<-P
This should make it so that we don't accidentally overwrite the original string. This function is instead
returning every possible combination, not every possible permutation

4) /* Fix me */
HammingStrings(P, d)
    Initialize S <- empty set
    PossibleNeighbors = (|P|! / |P|! - d!)
    for i <- 0 to PossibleNeighbors
        Text(P,



5) Palindromes(Text, k)
    for i <- 0 to |Text| - k
        String curr = Substring(Text, i, k) // Grab the substring
        String tmp = Reverse(curr) // Reverses string
        Complement(tmp) // Converts all nucleotides to its complement (e.g. A->T, G->C)
        if (tmp == curr)
            print(curr)

    The run time for Palindromes would be (|Text| - k)*k^2, since we first have to iterate through the |Text| - k. We have to iterate
    through the substring of Text k number of times for the reverse and complement functions. substring should be fast since it would
    be a native function of the programming language. So, it would be O(n^3) since all in all we are iterating through the string 3 times.




6) You can tell where the replication origin is by looking at where the skew changes
a negative to positive slope (the global minimum). We know this because the skew diagram
shows us the difference between G & C nucleotides, and the oriC is where we find the greatest
difference. Also, since bacterial genomes are circular, the last position on a skew diagram flows directly
over into the beginning position for the skew diagram.
